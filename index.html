		<h1> ASSASSINATION CLASSROOM </h1>
		</center>
		<p>
				Assassination Classroom (Ansatsu Kyoushitsu) is a Japanese comic science fiction manga series written and illustrated by Yusei Matsui. 
			Earth is threatened by an enormously powerful monster who destroyed 70% of the Moon with its power, permanently rending it into the shape of a crescent. 
			The monster claims that within a year, Earth will also be destroyed by him, but he offers mankind a chance to avert this fate. 
			In class 3-E at Kunugigaoka Junior High School, he starts working as a homeroom teacher where he teaches his students not only regular subjects, but the ways of assassination. 
			The Japanese government promises a reward of 10 billion yen(i.e. 100 million USD) to whoever among the students succeeds in killing the monster, 
			whom they have named "Koro-sensei" (a pun on korosenai (unkillable) and sensei (teacher)). 
			However, this has proven to be an almost impossible task, as not only does he have several superpowers at his disposal, 
			including the capacity of moving at Mach 20, but he is also the best teacher they've ever had, helping them not only to improve their grades, 
			but also their individual skills and perspectives for the future. <p>
